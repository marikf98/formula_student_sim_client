# About Us
The BGRacing team is the Formula Student group from Ben-Gurion University, comprised of 30-50 students from diverse departments such as Business Management and Engineering.

We participate in the Formula Student (FSA) competition, an annual international event organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International).
This prestigious competition invites engineering students from around the globe to design, build, and present commercially viable single-seat prototype racecars.


In the 2019 Formula SAE Italy competition, the BGR team achieved remarkable success by winning the esteemed "Driving the Future" honor awarded by DRiV™.
This recognition was earned during the event's 15th edition, where the team distinguished itself by embodying DRiV™'s fundamental values: Integrity, a collaborative spirit, a relentless drive for excellence, and a forward-thinking vision aimed at fostering positive change for the future.
Their performance not only showcased technical prowess but also demonstrated a deep commitment to innovation and a shared mission to advance automotive engineering.
